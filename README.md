pygrep-hooks
============

A collection of fast, cheap, regex based pre-commit hooks.


### Adding to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks
    rev: v1.10.0  # Use the ref you want to point at
    hooks:
    -   id: python-use-type-annotations
    # ...
```

### Naming conventions

Where possible, these hooks will be prefixed with the file types they target.
For example, a hook which targets python will be called `python-...`.

### Provided hooks

[generated]: # (generated)
- **`python-check-blanket-noqa`**: Enforce that `noqa` annotations always occur with specific codes. Sample annotations: `# noqa: F401`, `# noqa: F401,W203`
- **`python-check-blanket-type-ignore`**: Enforce that `# type: ignore` annotations always occur with specific codes. Sample annotations: `# type: ignore[attr-defined]`, `# type: ignore[attr-defined, name-defined]`
- **`python-check-mock-methods`**: Prevent common mistakes of `assert mck.not_called()`, `assert mck.called_once_with(...)` and `mck.assert_called`.
- **`python-no-eval`**: A quick check for the `eval()` built-in function
- **`python-no-log-warn`**: A quick check for the deprecated `.warn()` method of python loggers
- **`python-no-lstrip-rstrip-with-literal-str`**: A quick check for lstrip or rstrip calls that should use removeprefix or removesuffix
- **`python-use-type-annotations`**: Enforce that python3.6+ type annotations are used instead of type comments
- **`rst-backticks`**: Detect common mistake of using single backticks when writing rst
- **`rst-directive-colons`**: Detect mistake of rst directive not ending with double colon or space before the double colon
- **`rst-inline-touching-normal`**: Detect mistake of inline code touching normal text in rst
