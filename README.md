pygrep-hooks
============

A collection of fast, cheap, regex based pre-commit hooks.


### Adding to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks
    rev: v1.6.0  # Use the ref you want to point at
    hooks:
    -   id: python-use-type-annotations
    # ...
```

### Naming conventions

Where possible, these hooks will be prefixed with the file types they target.
For example, a hook which targets python will be called `python-...`.

### Provided hooks
